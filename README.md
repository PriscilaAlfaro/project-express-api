# Week 17- Technigo Bootcamp

# Express API Project

This week's project is to start studying backend by creating an API using Express. The API should have at least a couple of RESTful endpoints which return either an array of data, or a single item. I used a hard-coded set of data, stored as a JSON file in the project.

## The problem

I started following the guide in the videos of the week. This is a topic that is not new for me, so for this week was a really nice re-study and good to remember basic stuff related with REST API and very basic endpoints with hard-code data. At the end of the project I deployed it in Heroku.
